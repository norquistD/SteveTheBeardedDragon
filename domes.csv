desert,1,Enterance,"How does it feel different as you walk into the desert? How did you expect it to feel?"
desert,2,"Madagascar Collection","Let's move it, move it to Madagascar! Because Madagascar is an island, isolated from Africa's mainland, the plant species here have evolved like nowhere else on Earth. Our collection is the largest collection of these plants outside of Madagascar. It's our rarest and most expensive collection!"
desert,3,"Dragon Blood Tree","On this small "island" is the Canary Island dragon blood tree. Named in medieval times, its red sap was marketed as "dragon's blood", the sap was used as medicine, lipstick, and even varnish for violins. Beow are many aeoniums: leafy succulents that resemble green daisies."
desert,4,Cycad,"Speaking of dragons, can you find the dragon egg? Its actually the cone of an African cycad! Most Cycads create a cone every 3-5 years. Our cycad is likely a two headede plant. Its seems more frequent, make a cone almost every year! How lucky!"
desert,5,"The Oasis","An oasis is a fertile, life sustaining area that provides habitat for animals. Natural surface water may be present, or water may only be accessible from wells or underground channels created by humans."
desert,D,Doves,"Look closely for our resident collared doves. Can you guess how they got that name? Their favorite places are on the map. Our Doves: Fazil - Darker, with ear holes. Shafi - No distinguishing marks."
desert,6,"Living Stones","Lithops are neat little plants from southern Africa that only grow 1-3 inches tall. They were discovered by William Burchell in 1811, first thinking they were just stones."
desert,7,"Ponytail Palm","Ponytail Palms, native to eastern Mexico's cliffs and mountains, are near extinction due to threats like mining and illegal harvesting for the houseplant trade. Where do you think it stores its water?"
desert,8,Agave,"The agave's roughly 20 feet tall flower stalks are pollinated by the Mexican long-nosed bat which spreads pollen on its fur. Traditionally used by the Aztecs, agave is 1.5 times sweeter than sugar! Yum!"
desert,9,"Prickly Pear","Prickly pear, native to the Americas, produces fruit known as 'tuna' and large green pads called 'nopal', which are common in Mexican cuisine. Pack rats often make dens here!"
desert,10,"Giant Saguaro","The Saguaro Cactus is unique to America's Sonoran Desert. This is the iconic cactus that most people picture when they think of a cactus. It grows slowly, at about 1 inch every 10 years, and typically develops its first 'arm' after around 50 years."
desert,11,"Queen of the Night","This cactus produces a unique flower that blooms only once a year for a single night, making it a rare and fleeting sight. It requires a flying pollinator that comes out at night. Any guesses? Its a bat! The plant is known for producing dragon fruit."
show,1,Enterance,"The Show Dome hosts 5 themed floral displays each year. Read the poster at the right of the entrance regarding the current theme. The Process: Themes are planned a year in advance, and plants are grown for months in our greenhouses, being timed perfectly to bloom when the Show opens- and to fill in new blooms through the Show. Between shows, the Dome closes for two weeks for a rapid transformation led by horticulturists, a Parks artist, and Parks staff. some more permanent features, like the conservatory, gates, gazebo, and Perimeter Plants, remain in place year-round."
show,2,Jaboticaba,"Can you Jaboticaba? JAH-BOO-TI-CAH-BAH. This cauliflorous tree (like the 'Cauliflower', which means that the flowers and fruits grow directly from the trunks), produces fruit that looks and tastes like grapes but has tougher skin and 1-5 times larger flat seeds."
show,3,"Scented Geranium","There are multiple types of uniquely scented geraniums here, including lemon and chocolate mint. Gently rub the leaf to release the oils, and give them a sniff! The scents are believed to have calming, stree-reducing effects. Do you agree?"
show,4,"Fig Trees","The Fascinating, Fantastic Fig! Fig fruits are eaten raw, dried, or cooked - with Golden (tan, slightly nutty flavor) and Mission (purple and sweet) being popular. Figs made their commercial product debut with the 1892 introduction of the Fig Newtons cookies. Figs are Interesting pollinators: Figs are special because their flowers grow inside the fruit! Tiny wasps help pollinate them by crawling into a little hole, spreading pollen, laying eggs, then dying inside. Don't worry, the crunch you hear when you a eat fig is not the remains of a wasp, it's the seeds. Figs produce an enzyme that digests the wasps, so the wasp disappears. Plus, the figs we buy in the store don't need wasps - they have been specially cultivated to self-pollinate."
show,5,Citruses,"Can you name a citrus fruit? Citrus fruits (lemons, limes, oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, and more) contain Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and potassium which helps prevent diseases. Scurvy is a disease caused by a serious Vitamin C deficiency. A single citrus plant has up to 60,000 flowers, but only 1% will become fruit. The Meyer Lemon originated in China and is likely the cross between a mandarin and a lemon. The technical name for a citrus peel is called a pericarp! The Citruses may be moved to our greenhouses in cold months to stay warm!"
show,6,Magnolia,"Through the warm months the large flowers of the Southern magnolia tree, or 'Majestic Beauty', open and release their strong, pleasant fragrance - reminiscent of lemons. With some of the oldest flowers ever known (100 million years), they predate bees! The "cone" of the magnolia is actually a woody fruit. How are they pollinated? The flower has a specifically evolved to encourage beetles to pollinate! Can you spot the two other Southern Magnolias in this Dome?"
show,7,"Olives & Herbs","Fruiting olives are a key part of the Mediterranean cooking and are among the oldest cultivated trees. They're inedible straight from the tree and must be processed and brined first. Around 90% of all harvested olives are pressed to make olive oil, with Spain producing roughly 44% of the world's supply. Below the olive tree you can find herbs, like lavender, which you can smell like Geraniums. Essential oils have been used in folk medicine for 1000s of years. Lavendar is by far the biggest seller in the essential oil business."
show,8,"The Old Conservatory","The original sunken garden featured 8 stones statues. Today, 7 of those statues (5 dragons and 2 lions) can be found around the Show Dome perimeter. Can you find them? Did you know there was a conservatory here before the Domes? The Mitchell Park Conservatory stood from 1898 to 1955, built in honor of the Mitchell family who donated the land until it was torn down. The Domes were built in its place. Some original features, like the iron gates and brick pavers are here - preserved from the original conservatory! Not just a conservatory: Mitchell Park contains 62 beautiful acres, with sports fields, trails, a pond, a playground, and tons of history! It was one of the first 6 Milwaukee County Parks."
tropical,1,Entrance,"Does it feel different as you walk into the rainforest? The Tropical Dome, completed in 1965, house over 1,200 plant species along with birds, fish, and a world of insects. Be sure to look at all the layers of the rainforest. Remember: the slower you walk, the more you will see! Though rainforests cover just 6% of the Earth's surface, they are vital for providing air, water, medicine, food, and shelter. Today's focus will be on some of these remarkable plants."
tropical,2,"Cacao Plant","Do you like chocolate? This tree produces cacao (KAH-KOW) beans, the main ingredient in chocolate. Look for its small flowers and pods! Cacao was so valuable that the aztecs once used it as currency."
tropical,3,"Black Pepper","Does anyone have salt and pepper on their tables at home? The pepper plant produces small red fruits called peppercorns. These berries contain seeds. Peppercorns are cooked, dried, and ground into Black Pepper, the most traded spice in the world."
tropical,4,Orchids,"This wall includes award winning orchids. Stop and smell them! Did you know orchids are one of the most prosperous flowering plants? There are more than 25,000 species of orchids, including vanilla! We have more orchids than mammals and birds on this planet. Orchids have been growing as far back as when the Earth was one big supercontinent!"
tropical,5,"Banana Plant","Banana plants are often mistaken for trees - they are actually herbs! Bananas grow from a bulb or rhizome. One species, the "ice cream banana" is sweeter and creamier then regular bananas. The red cone is the flower!"
tropical,6,"Bridge, Water, & Fish","The plant with very long roots near the waterfall is a South American Split-leaf Philodendron, which can grow to 70 feet tall! We have koi fish and goldfish that were donated to us. The oldest known koi fish was Hanako, who lived to be 226 years old!"
tropical,7,"Coffee Plant","This plant is where coffee comes from, yum! The tree produces fruit that when ripe (red), are havested for their seeds inside. These seeds are roasted and ground, like the seeds of the cacao tree. Also the Sausage Tree. No, not that type of sausage! These fruit can grow 2 feet long. Several animals eat this fruit in the wild: giraffes, elephants, monkeys, and even porcupines. We hand-pollinate it with sausage tree flowers from the Lincoln Park Conservatory in Chicago!"
tropical,8,"Coconut Palm","Coconuts aren't just found in the tropics - you may use products made from them every day. The hairy part, called coir (KOI-ER), is used in items like brushes and mats. Coconut oil is antibacterial and used in cosmetics, while the fles, or copra, is used for food and milk."
tropical,9,"Barbados Cherry","Unlike traditional cherries, the Barbados, West Indian, or Acerola cherries have smaller seeds rather than one pit. They hove one of the highest concerntrations of Vitamin C, making it popular in supplements!"
tropical,10,"Soursop/Guanabana","Can you say guanabana? WAN-NAH-BAN-NAH. This sweet fruit tastes like a mix of apple, pineapple, and banana! You can find it in various grocery stores and ice cream shops on Milwaukee's Southside. Look for flowers & fruit! (when in season)"
